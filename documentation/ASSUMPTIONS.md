# ASSUMPTIONS

## Responsiveness and SASS
I have made the assumption to use an off-the-shelf UI framework for the responsiveness aspect of this exercise.  Therefore, I've used Bootstrap (SASS) for the layout in the site, purely to ensure it functions well on standard breakpoints.

Given enough time, I'd liked to have used Material_UI, which is meant to integrate well with React.
