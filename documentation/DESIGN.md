# DESIGN

##    Components
I've structured the components folder for common layout elements and 'todo' related aspects.

##    Class
I've created a Task class, with parameters for its' current status:
- created
- edited 
- deleted
- completed

This would enable me to alter the 'state' and appearance / visibility of the tasks in the todo list.

##    Task Panel
The designs supplied don't indicate any functionality available to the users, so I want to add an edit, complete and delete icons.
With the selection of these the appropriate process will be carried out. i.e. Marking that task as completed, or deleting it from the list.

##    Storage of tasks
Whilst a sample.json file has been supplied, I think localStorage could be useful here to save tasks to a users device.
