# PROBLEMS / SOLUTIONS

|  Problem | Solution|
|----------| ----------|
| Never used next.js before... | Hit the next.js site and see what gives. Only to discover this stuff is pretty darned cool |
| Next used redux before...| ~~Step 1.  Use the sample data.json file to begin with for mocking out layout.~~<br /> Step 2. Look at redux after happy with layout / look'n'feel etc. <br /><br /> I've taken a bit longer than I would have liked to get this working. Which has left me without time to add icons and the edit functionality |
| Icons | Tried several ways to get icons to appear, using font-awesome; icomoons; all to no avail. Just used small buttons instead |
