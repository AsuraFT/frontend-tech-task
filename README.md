# Asura FT test

Asura FT Front-End Tech Test

# Introduction

The test is aimed at testing yours skills at setting up and creating a TODO tasks application with 
ReactJS using the [next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started) Framework.

The application should create, modify and delete tasks.

The tasks should also be persisted so that they survive a page refresh.

We expect the application to be unit tested. 
If you are pushed for time documenting how you would test the application is also sufficient

The UI must be responsive, accessible and pretty.

Have Fun!
